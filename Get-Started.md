[//]: # (GUI SETUP)

## Setting up using GUI

**Step 1**: 

Your computer may need some additional programs to access the Omega through a browser:
* If you are using Windows, install Apple's Bonjour Service
* If you are using OS X, you're all set to go
* If you are using Linux, the Zeroconf services should already be installed and you will be good to go

**Step 2**: Connect to the Omega’s Access Point.

**Step 3**: Use Chrome or Opera and navigate to `http://omega-ABCD.local` where ABCD are the same characters from the network name above. *Some users have experienced issues using Firefox and Safari.*

Alternatively, you can also browse to `http://192.168.3.1`. 

You have now arrived at the Setup Wizard. 
Login with the following information: 
```
username: root
password: onioneer 
```
Follow the wizard to complete the setup of the Omega.

Following the wizard will connect your Omega to a wifi network of your choice, and will update to the latest firmware.

**Step 4**: Start using your fresh Omega, check out the [Tutorials section](./Tutorials/Contents) or the [Project guides](./Projects/Contents) for ideas on what to do next!



[//]: # (OSX SETUP)

## Setting up using Command Line – OSX

**Step 1**: Download and install the [Silicon Labs CP2102 driver for OS X](https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip).

**Step 2**: Run `ls /dev/tty.*` to see if the USB-to-Serial device can be detected. If the driver is successfully installed, you should be able to see a device with a name similar to `/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART`.

![Check if serial device exists](//i.imgur.com/FLn2p35h.jpg "Check if serial device exists")

**Step 3**: Run `screen /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART 115200` to connect to the Omega’s serial terminal using the `screen` utility.

**Step 4**: Run `wifisetup` in the serial terminal, and follow the prompt to connect the Omega to your Wi-Fi network.

![Run wifisetup](//i.imgur.com/h21sjzRh.jpg "Run wifisetup")

**Step 5**: Run `oupgrade` in the serial terminal, this will update the Omega to the latest firmware.

The firmware update will take a few minutes, the process will be complete when the Omega reboots.
**Warning: Do not disconnect the Omega from wifi or power during this process!**

[//]: # (LINUX SETUP)

## Setting up using Command Line – Linux

**Step 1**: Check if the serial drivers are already installed.

Some modern Linux Distros already have the required serial drivers installed. Run `modinfo cp210x` on the command line, if it outputs several lines of information, the driver is already installed and you can skip ahead to **Step 4**. 

If the output is something along the lines of 
```
modinfo: ERROR: Module cp210x not found.
```
the driver will need to be installed. Continue to **Step 2**.


**Step 2**: Download and install the Silicon Labs CP2102 driver source files.

For Linux kernel **3.x.x and higher**: [[https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Linux_3.x.x_VCP_Driver_Source.zip]].
For Linux kernel **2.6.x**: [[https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Linux_3.x.x_VCP_Driver_Source.zip]].

**Step 3**: Build and install the driver.

*For Ubuntu/Debian*:

Unzip the archive.

`cd` into the unzipped directory.

Compile the driver with `make`.

```bash
sudo cp cp210x.ko /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/
sudo insmod /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.ko
sudo insmod cp210x.ko
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

(You may need to logout and back in for the new group to take effect.)


*For RedHat/CentOS*:

```bash
sudo yum update kernel* //need to update the kernel first otherwise your header n't match
sudo yum install kernel-devel kernel-headers //get the devel and header packages
sudo reboot //your build link should be fixed after your system come back
```

Unzip the archive.

`cd` into the unzipped directory.

Compile the driver with `make`.

```bash
sudo cp cp210x.ko /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/drivers/usb/serial
sudo insmod /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.ko
sudo insmod cp210x.ko
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

(You may need to logout and back in for the new group to take effect.)


**Step 4**: Let's install `screen`, a command line utility that will allow connecting to the Omega's serial terminal.

*For Ubuntu/Debian*:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install screen
```

*For RedHat/CentOS*:

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install screen
```


**Step 5**: Run `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` to see if the USB-to-Serial device can be detected. If the driver is successfully installed, you should be able to see a device with a name similar to `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

![Check if serial device exists](//i.imgur.com/p1OwSE6h.png "Check if serial device exists")

**Step 6**: Run `sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200` to connect to the Omega’s serial terminal using screen. 

![Log in through serial terminal](//i.imgur.com/sENEIX8h.png "Log in through serial terminal")

**Step 7**: Run `wifisetup` in the serial terminal, and follow the prompt to connect the Omega to your Wi-Fi network.

![Run wifisetup](//i.imgur.com/qou4iAmh.png "Run wifisetup")

**Step 8**: Run `oupgrade` in the serial terminal, this will update the Omega to the latest firmware.

The firmware update will take a few minutes, the process will be complete when the Omega reboots.
**Warning: Do not disconnect the Omega from wifi or power during this process!**
